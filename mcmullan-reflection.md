# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Personally, I was really struggling with the whole process, especially understanding the differences between staging and committing as well as merging.
  * I also was struggling to rememeber to pull from master.
  * I was also struggling with branching concepts.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Everything is much clearer!
  * Branching, in particular, makes way more sense.
  * I also have a better understanding of how to actually commit and merge files without having a conflict.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I asked a million questions to Andres. I asked questions about markdown, about branching and staging, and about actual commands. Whenever we didn't know something we would look it up!
  * We mostly asked Aji questions about syntax.

# What still confuses you about Git?
  * I think I have a much better understanding, especially as it relates to adding and merging, staging, submitting PRs, etc. I just need way more practice!

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * It was really helpful! I think that my time working with Andres was more valuable than our time with Aji. After our initial session, Andres and I spent an additional 4ish hours working together on concepts and getting through the challenge.
  * It took much longer than I anticipated, but was really helpful, especally with such a thoughtful and methodical partner.
  * teamwork makes the dream work!
