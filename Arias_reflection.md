What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 *I was struggling with the whole branching concepts and finally with the merging and merging conflict resolution process.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  *We got  practice on both topics i used to be confused with. At this point it seems I have a better grasp on those.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  *We asked the guide for some syntax questions we had, as for my partner we asked too many questions to keep count. We took turns answering our questions and looking up answers.
What still confuses you about Git?
  *I think we understand the basic git work flow and the basic commands, just enough to be able to work properly and efficiently. from this point we just need to practice what we've learned.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  *I enjoyed the first GPS, it showed the value of teamwork and rapport between team members. It showed me that not one person knows all the answers and that is ok, that is where team work come in and in the end we managed to get through all the challenges.
